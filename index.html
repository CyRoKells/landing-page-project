I am a Stay At Home Mom just trying to hang on to whatever remains of my sanity. <em>News Flash</em> it's not much. My job is to make sure the small boy doesn't kill himself during the day, as well as feeding and playing with him. Oh, and attempting to clean up the infinite mess he creates hourly.</figcaption>

We are currently trying to teach him how to speak but I think in a year we will probably come to regret that decision.</figcaption>
